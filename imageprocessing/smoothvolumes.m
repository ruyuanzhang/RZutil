function [vols,flt] = smoothvolumes(vols,volsize,fwhm)

% function [vols,flt] = smoothvolumes(vols,volsize,fwhm)
%
% <vols> are one or more 3D volumes concatenated along the fourth dimension
%   or a cell vector of things like that.
% <volsize> is a 3-element vector with the voxel size
% <fwhm> is a 3-element vector with the desired FWHM of a Gaussian filter
%
% smooth <vols> using a Gaussian filter (values below 0.01 are zeroed out).
% we perform the filtering using imfilter and the 'replicate' option.
% also, we handle NaNs intelligently by not allowing them to enter the 
% filtering operation.  however, voxels that are originally NaN are forced
% to be NaN in the output.
%
% we also return the filter in <flt>.  the values sum to 1.
%
% it appears that this function is compatible with integer data formats
% as well as complex-valued data.
%
% history:
% 2011/08/23 - now return <flt>
% 2011/03/08 - handle NaNs intelligently now. this changes old behavior.
%
% example:
% a = getsamplebrain;
% a(rand(size(a))>.9) = NaN;
% a2 = smoothvolumes(a,[2.5 2.5 2.5],[5 5 5]);
% figure; imagesc(makeimagestack(a));
% figure; imagesc(makeimagestack(a2));

% otherwise, do the normal case
sd = (fwhm ./ volsize)/(2*sqrt(2*log(2)));  % first convert to matrix units, then to standard deviations
flt = l1unitlength(constructsmoothingfilter(sd,0.01));
if iscell(vols)
  for zz=1:length(vols)
    for p=1:size(vols{zz},4)
      vols{zz}(:,:,:,p) = smoothvolumes_helper(vols{zz}(:,:,:,p),flt);
    end
  end
else
  for p=1:size(vols,4)
    vols(:,:,:,p) = smoothvolumes_helper(vols(:,:,:,p),flt);
  end
